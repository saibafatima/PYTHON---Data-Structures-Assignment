# Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?

print(" variables are used to store and refer to data values. They act as named containers that hold a specific value or data.")

variable_name = "value"

# Variable declaration and assignment
name = "John"
age = 25
height = 1.75

# Printing the values stored in variables
print(name)    # Output: John
print(age)     # Output: 25
print(height)  # Output: 1.75

x = 5  # initial assignment
print(x)  # Output: 5

x = 10  # reassignment
print(x)  # Output: 10
